‚ú® Contributions
Pull requests are welcome! If you have creative ideas for new quantum visualizations or interactive features, we'd love to hear them.



## Inspiration
Gaining familiarity with Qiskit and learning more about quantum computing / concepts.
## What it does
Provides detailed information about basic quantum concepts while allowing users to create their own quantum circuits and visualize them in various ways.
## How we built it
We used Streamlit for the frontend side of things, Python for the backend, as well as Matplotlib for visualizations.
## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenges we ran into were primarily conceptual. In other words, it was challenging for us at times to visualize what we wanted to see with our project, primarily due to our inexperience with quantum concepts.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned a lot about a field we were previously had zero knowledge of.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about working with Qiskit, and gained a larger wealth of knowledge regarding quantum concepts which we were previously unfamiliar with.
## What's next for Q-Learn
Finding a more useful application for it, as its primary purpose currently is essentially just to give a rudimentary demonstration of quantum concepts.
